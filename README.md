## Project orientation

The project is centered on personal writing and interior experience.

The writings engage creation and testimony as ways of surviving
extreme trauma. They attempt to speak from within the unutterable,
silence, and rupture.

Texts are presented as fragments, poems, sequences, and diary entries.
